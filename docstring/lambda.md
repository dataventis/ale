Will create a lambda function that may be passed around in a first-class manner.

#### An Example

```scheme
(define double
  (let [mul 2]
    (lambda (x) (\* x mul))))

(seq->vector
  (map double '(1 2 3 4 5 6)))
```

This example will return the vector _[2 4 6 8 10 12]_.

Lambdas produce a closure that copies the bindings that have been referenced from the surrounding scope.

Will bind a value to a global name. All bindings are immutable and result in an error being raised if an attempt is made to re-bind them. This behavior is different from most Lisps, as they will generally fail silently in such cases.

#### An Example

```scheme
(define x
  (map
    (lambda (y) (\* y 2))
    seq1 seq2 seq3))
```

This example will create a lazy map where each element of the three provided sequences is doubled upon request. It will then bind that lazy map to the name _x_.

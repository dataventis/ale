Like `delay`, but if the first forced result is a promise, it will continue to be forced until a non-promise result is capable of being returned.

#### An Example

```scheme
(define p (lazy
            (println "hello once")
            (delay
              (println "hello twice")
              "hello")))
(force p) ;; prints "hello once / hello twice"
(force p)
```

The first invocation of `p` will print _"hello once"_ followed by _"hello twice"_ to the console, also returning the string _"hello"_. Subsequent invocations of `p` will only return _"hello"_.

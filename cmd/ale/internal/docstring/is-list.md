If all forms evaluate to a list, then this function will return _#t_ (true). The first non-list will result in the function returning _#f_ (false).

#### An Example

```scheme
(list? '(1 2 3 4) [5 6 7 8])
```

This example will return _#f_ (false) because the second form is a vector.

Like most predicates, this function can also be negated by prepending the `!` character. This means that all the provided forms must not be lists.

```scheme
(!list? "hello" [99])
```

This example will return _#t_ (true).

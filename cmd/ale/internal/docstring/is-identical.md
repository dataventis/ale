Return _#f_ (false) as soon as it encounters a form that is not identical to the
first. Otherwise, will return _#t_ (true).

#### An Example

```scheme
(define h "hello")
(eq "hello" h)
```

Like most predicates, this function can also be negated by prepending the `!`
character. In this case, _#t_ (true) will be returned if not all forms are
equal.

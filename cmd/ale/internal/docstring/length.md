The `length` function will return the number of elements in a sequence.

If the sequence is lazily computed, asynchronous, or otherwise incapable of returning a count, this function will raise an error. To perform a brute-force count of a sequence, use the `length!` function, keeping in mind that it may never return a result.

#### An Example

```scheme
(length '(1 2 3 4))
```

This example will return _4_.

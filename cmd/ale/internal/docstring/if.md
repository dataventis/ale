If the evaluated predicate is truthy (not _#f_ (false) or the empty list), the _then_ form is evaluated and returned, otherwise the _else_ form, if any, will be evaluated and returned.

#### An Example

```scheme
(define x '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8))

(if (> (length x) 3)
    "x is big"
    "x is small")
```

If the symbol `unless` is used instead of `if`, then the logical branching will be inverted.

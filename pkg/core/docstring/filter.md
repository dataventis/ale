Creates a lazy sequence whose content is the result of applying the provided function to the elements of the provided sequence. If the result of the application is truthy (not false), then the value will be included in the resulting sequence.

#### An Example

```scheme
(filter (lambda (x) (< x 3)) [1 2 3 4])
```

This will return the lazy sequence _(1 2)_

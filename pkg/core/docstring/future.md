Returns a future in the form of a function. The provided forms will be evaluated in a separate thread of execution, and any calls to the function **will block** until the forms have been completely evaluated.

#### An Example

```scheme
(define fut (future
  (seq->vector (generate
    (emit "red")
    (emit "orange")
    (emit "yellow")))))

(fut)
```

This example produces a future called _fut_ that converts the results of an asynchronous block into a vector. The `(fut)` call will block until the future returns a value.
